# Datat Visualization

## Programming language: R

## DEscription

This is an example of lab activity fro MEDI504 course. The lecture was taught by Firas Moosvi and was dedicated to topic DATA SCIENCE: HOW DO YOU SPEAK THE LANGUAGE?
I was responsible for teaching teh lab portion and developing teh lab materials for MEDI course.

In this lab teh focus was given for such activities as:
1. Being able to reproduce teh image given
2. Using a principles of good visualizations, correct the "ugly"plot
3. the last exercise is an additional "challenge "exercise for students who has already mastered the skills of datat visualization, but require an additional complex data visualization skills. This exercise was inspired by my work with Equity & Inclusion Scholar Program where I am responsible to analyze the datat regarding student demographics. Several of teh challenges that student face in this exercise are
  - Multidimensionality data. Most of teh datat visualization example provided in the books and tutorial are associated with single input ( ie when student choose teh ethnicity, it is a single option) . Which completely fails to address the current picture of Equity, Diversity and Inclusion at our university. UBC acknowldge that students are share a complex student identity- and hence the student can choose mor ethan one ethnic identity in teh surveys. the similar situation is directly related to students spoken languages- where a high number of students can speak mor ethan one language.
  - ethical data decision: to prepare the visualizations that adequatly reflect teh diverse population of students at UBC
