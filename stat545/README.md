I also think that it is important to create open source materials to overcome the financial struggle for students in obtaining expensive books. STAT 545 (and STAT 547) course uses an open source textbook designed by various TAs and instructors at UBC that introduce students to coding in R and use of GitHub for collaboration and reproducible analysis of the data. I have been involved in creating a content for several lectures. The full version of this lecture is available from https://stat545guidebook.netlify.com/working-with-factors-in-r.html. As this class is teaching student how to program in R, it was very important to design a class that does real-time coding, so that student learn by writing the code themselves. However, some parts of the code have to be given to minimise the frustration of the students who are totally unfamiliar with the topic.
